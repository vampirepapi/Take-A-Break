## Let's get started
we need to download two important packages for this application.
1.  requests (for fetching data from the web)

>  **pip install requests**

2. plyer (for creating notifications on your PC)

> **pip install plyer**

**time.sleep ()— tells after what interval of time the notification should popup** [mine is 2.5 hours]

## **How to make a python application to run in the background?**

Just follow this simple command to make your application run in the background, note you need to type this command in command prompt.

    pythonw.exe .\<your-file-name-here>
    example:-
    pythonw.exe .\desktopNotifier.py

Voila your application now starts running in the background.
